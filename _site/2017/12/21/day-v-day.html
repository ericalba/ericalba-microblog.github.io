  <p>Day 01 v. Day 18,263</p>

<p>Some people say I‚Äôve had many lives. ü§î maybe. - Grew up in New Jersey/Southern California. Catholic school in there somewhere. - Worked @ Disneyland in High School, every kind of job, stayed on 4 more years. Plus 2 more jobs to pay bills. - Had crisis, quit all jobs. Swore I wouldn‚Äôt take another job until ‚ÄúIt was the job I would have for the rest of my life.‚Äù (I was an idiot) - Became homeless, surfed couches. lived in car, car repossessed. Then lived in storage facility near In-N-Out &amp; AM/PM. Everyday ate AM/PM, good days ate In-N-Out. Really good days, friends buy me food. - While homeless, became Ticket Scalper for sports &amp; shows. Everyday I‚Äòm hustlin. - Friend got me job for night shift videotape operator. Things got better. I learn editing on side. - Another friend, comvinces me to take class in Visual Effects at facility doing effects for TV show Star Trek: The Next Generation. I learned, met all artists working on show. This was also great. I knew what i wanted to do with my life. - Another good friend gets me interview for internship in Post &amp; VFX. I meet producer, am offered full-time, Un-Paid internship. I took it &amp; did that &amp; real job simultaneously. Brutal but work was understanding, adjusts my schedule to do both. - I do internship for months, was hired in VFX Dept for next season of Star Trek: TNG &amp; DS9.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt goto college. Disneyland was my college. I didn‚Äôt goto Film School, Star Trek was my Film School. Most of what I learned about filmmaking was from hundreds of crew, generous to teach me. I will never forget that experience. - Friend working on another TV show offered me VFX Supervisor job on TV show in Vancouver. I took it. After that, I continued to work as Supervisor/Producer on too many projects for over 20 years. Now in NYC where I still work in bleeding edge technology.</p>

<p>I would definitely not be where I am if not for my friends &amp; their trust in me. Every opportunity was from a friend. Show your appreciation when you can.</p>

<p>But life isn‚Äôt all work. To quote Ferris Bueller, ‚ÄúLife moves pretty fast. If you don‚Äôt stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it.‚Äù Live your life. üíØüôè‚ù§Ô∏èüôå</p>
