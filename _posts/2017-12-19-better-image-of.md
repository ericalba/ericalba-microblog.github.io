Better image of “Telestron“ . Thanks to @VTProDesign for giving @kindakash and I a preview before launch at @DayForNightFest . I stood in line to see this 6 Times during the fest. And I hate lines. 
I showed a video of your piece to a child and he has some questions: 
1. What are the robots’ names? 
2. Are they friends? (if “No”, he says they should be friends) and 
3. Are they talking to each other? 
I hope you got some answers. 😉
