#Impatient
1:30pm on a weekday. I grab a cab outside Blue Ribbon Sushi by Colombia Circle. I open cab door and then this. 
I’m just trying to think of the scenario leading up to this beautiful package being torn apart and just left in the door pocket. 
Was it a #nooner thing? Was it all going down IN the cab?! Was it planned or did someone spontaneously get the green light to get their F on and they just said “damn, Yo Taxi! [Insert Address Here] BUT first, I need to stop at a bodega.”? I want to know. Pls submit your theories here.
