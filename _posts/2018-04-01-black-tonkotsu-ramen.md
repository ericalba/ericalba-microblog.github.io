Black Tonkotsu Ramen:  Served w/ Chashu (Roasted Park), Moyashi (Bean Sprouts), Tomorokoshi (Corn), Negi (Scallions), Tamago (Boiled Egg). Great, solid ramen. Bonus, the Pan-Fried Shrimp & Ground Pork Gyoza Served w/ Spicy Mustard was perfect and also a big reason to come back. 
Thanks @lloyd_alvarez for the tip!
