Day 01 v. Day 18,263

Some people say I've had many lives. ü§î maybe. - Grew up in New Jersey/Southern California. Catholic school in there somewhere. - Worked @ Disneyland in High School, every kind of job, stayed on 4 more years. Plus 2 more jobs to pay bills. - Had crisis, quit all jobs. Swore I wouldn't take another job until "It was the job I would have for the rest of my life." (I was an idiot) - Became homeless, surfed couches. lived in car, car repossessed. Then lived in storage facility near In-N-Out & AM/PM. Everyday ate AM/PM, good days ate In-N-Out. Really good days, friends buy me food. - While homeless, became Ticket Scalper for sports & shows. Everyday I‚Äòm hustlin. - Friend got me job for night shift videotape operator. Things got better. I learn editing on side. - Another friend, comvinces me to take class in Visual Effects at facility doing effects for TV show Star Trek: The Next Generation. I learned, met all artists working on show. This was also great. I knew what i wanted to do with my life. - Another good friend gets me interview for internship in Post & VFX. I meet producer, am offered full-time, Un-Paid internship. I took it & did that & real job simultaneously. Brutal but work was understanding, adjusts my schedule to do both. - I do internship for months, was hired in VFX Dept for next season of Star Trek: TNG & DS9.

I didn't goto college. Disneyland was my college. I didn't goto Film School, Star Trek was my Film School. Most of what I learned about filmmaking was from hundreds of crew, generous to teach me. I will never forget that experience. - Friend working on another TV show offered me VFX Supervisor job on TV show in Vancouver. I took it. After that, I continued to work as Supervisor/Producer on too many projects for over 20 years. Now in NYC where I still work in bleeding edge technology.

I would definitely not be where I am if not for my friends & their trust in me. Every opportunity was from a friend. Show your appreciation when you can.

But life isn't all work. To quote Ferris Bueller, "Life moves pretty fast. If you don‚Äôt stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it." Live your life. üíØüôè‚ù§Ô∏èüôå
