just deleted my old github pages repo
started a new one ericalba.github.io
added new erialba/ericalba.gihub.io and personal access token 

there seems to be missing steps, 

do i do deploy a default jekyll install into this repo first? I'm going to try it without first and see what happens.

here we go.
